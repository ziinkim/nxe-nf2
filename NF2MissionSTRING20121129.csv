Welcome to the Aircraft Carrier training center.The CV class is a ship that can use several types of aircraft.
In this course, let's learn how to control the Dive Bomber which can attack enemies from long distance.
The Dive Bomber is an aircraft that flies over the top of enemy ships and bombs foes by taking a sudden, vertical drop. This type of attack is useful against ships that are slow; such as Battle Cruisers and Carriers. It is also useful when attacking bases. Now let's learn more about CV and dive bombers.
Unlike other ships, the CV class uses a special UI to control aircrafts. The arrow is pointing at a grey button which is the aircraft squad. If you press this button, the aircraft UI appears. Please first select aircraft squad button.
Currently there are only Dive bombers loaded on your ship, but if you have other types of aircrafts, you can select them by pressing the arrow buttons that are ext to the aircraft icon.
Next you'll have to select how many aircraft you are willing to launch.You can set this by using the arrow buttons that are next to the area with the relevant numbers. You can select from 1 to the maximum number this ship can launch at once.
If you select a high number, you can launch all of them at once, but beware that additional time is necessary to launch more aircrafts. So, it is wise to select a specific number of aircrafts that are needed for different situation.
After you have selected the number to launch, press the 'Ready' button.When you press this button, the aircraft status will change to 'Ready' status.Press the 'Ready' button.
After you press this button, you'll see the green circle in the aircraft status panel being activated. If the green fills up the status panel, this means the squad is able to launch. The 'Ready' button will change to 'T.O.' (Take Off) button.
Everything is set for launch now. Please press the 'T.O.' button and launch the squad.
Good job. Now let's learn how to control aircraft.
Let me teach you how to select an aircraft squadron. There are 3 ways to select any squadron. First, you can use a hotkey to select them. The hotkey is Left Shift + Squad Number. If you wish to continue, please press the Next button.
If you want to select Squad No.1, press Shift + 1. If you want to select Squad No.2, press Shift + 2 instead. Press Next to continue.
When you have selected the aircraft squad, you are unable to control the ship. To go back to ship control, you have to select the armament panel hot key.
Let's try going back to ship control. Press the Next button, and press a number between 1 and 4 to go back to ship control.
There are two other ways to select a squadron. Firstly, you can select the group of aircraft using the Formation button in the bottom right. You may also push Ctrl and drag over a map area to select the squadron. All aircraft within that area will be selected. Push Next to continue.
Try selecting the squad in the sky once more. Press the Next button and try selecting the squad.
Now let's learn how to move the aircrafts. This is very simple. Select the squad you wish to control and click the location which you wish to move them towards with the right mouse click.
Try moving your aircraft squad. Press the Next button and move the squad into the green circle.
Now, let's learn how to control the altitude of the aircraft. The arrow is pointing at the button to lower the altitude. If you press this button, you'll be able to see the altitude going down slowly.
Try lowering the altitude. Press the Next button and press the button to lower the altitude to the lowest point.
Well done. Now let's raise the altitude back up.If you press the raise altitude  button which the arrow is pointing at, the aircraft will rise higher into the sky.Press the Next button and increase the altitude of the aircraft to the highest point.
Now let's try an attack using the dive bombers.On the top right part of the map, there is a target ship.Press the Next button, and select the dive bomber squad and move the squad near the target.
We have found the target. On the status info for the squad you are controlling, right-click on the target and you'll see the attack target sign. The squad will fly over the target and drop down vertically when they are above the target.  When the squad is performing the vertical drop, 
you can press the space bar and the squad will drop the bomb towards the target. The accuracy of bombing the target will increase if the bomb dropping point is closer to the target. So it is important to find a good position for dropping the bombs.Press the Next button and try attacking the target.
After the squads have dropped their bombs, they will return back to the ship.You can also change their direction and altitude while they are returning. If you press the 'Return' button from the Aircraft UI, you can force the squad to return to the ship.
The return button is the button that is shaped like a U-turn. Press the Next button and recall the squad back to the ship.
Now you have learned how to use dive bombers. For the last step, use your skills to bomb two target ships with your dive bombers.

Friendly fleet was attacked by the enemy fleet! Make sortie now!
Two of the flotilla have been identified. Increase our vessels and surround them. 
We've arrived at the battle site. I'll send additional vessels to take them down!
They're getting away! Follow them to the end and annihilate them!
What are you doing?! Any more damage, and we'll all be killed!
No, we can't hold on any longer…
No, they've got us! All remaining vessels return!
That's enough. Retreat before we receive any more damage!
We really took a beating… but you did well.
Not enough coal. Search for a ship to require coal. 
Fortunately, I see a neutral merchant ship there. Fire our guns to stop the merchant ship. 
Goal: Hit merchant ship

I am Muller, the captain of this ship. I will provide you with money and supplies, and I suggest that you take the prisoners of our ship to a nearby port. 
I'm sorry, but I have to decline your request. My ship is already over boarded. 
That's a shame. Let's get going then. 
No, that boat must have reported us. Get away at full speed so that they don't catch up to us!
Take the freight from the freight ship you see over there. 
Goal: Hit Trabboch
Goal: Approach Trabboch
Take all the freight, and the seamen will be taken as prisoners. Move them quickly and set explosives on the ship!

Send them all to Calcutta right away. 
That ship seems to have seen the explosion of that ship we just sunk. Pursue them and stop that ship!
Goal: Hit Clan Matheson

Attack another target. 
Run quickly! We will change our direction to southwest!
Never knew we'd run from here like this… I'm so mad! Nonetheless, we have no other choice, so retreat quickly. 
Damn, they're following us! First, buy us some time until the other vessel gets away!
We will take care of this place from here. You go help the vessel that got away first!
It seems that the friendly vessel has been destroyed…
They're following us! Our fleet vessels are going through emergency repairs... Buy us some time!
We will take care of the enemies so you… escape to the west!
Too many enemies are after us! Go west as quickly as possible!
I'm so upset… The vessel that went east was also shot down…
Too many enemies…Focus on retreat rather instead of returning fire!
Enemy auxiliary troops! We must evade their attacks as much as possible and not return fire! 
We've suffered so much damage, but we succeeded in retreating. I will go report the battle results. 
This is the Admiralty Alpha Fleet… Good job on getting to the marked location… Friendly fleets will arrive soon… Standby… 
Phew~ We finally got here... Let's get together with the Alpha fleet soon. 
We haven't detected any German fleets yet, so let's wait until we make our move.
This is Charlie fleet… We will begin searching for German fleets right away. 
We detected a German fleet vessel patrolling the Helgoland region… The enemies haven't yet found us…
Okay… I will give the order.. Attack the German patrolling vessel, shoot them down, and quickly strike the German fleet docked on the Helgoland.                                                                                        Lead the German fleet after the first battle to us so that we can take them down in one go. 
Alpha fleet… We'll guide you, so stay with us…
Don't slow down, shoot the patrolling vessel down quickly, and attack the Helgoland German fleet.
Enemy ambush… All vessels get ready for sortie and take them down!!
If we keep fighting, we'll receive too much damage…. Retreat quickly and lead them… 
Ha ha ha! They're retreating! Follow them and take them all down!
A friendly auxiliary fleet has arrived at the goal location. 
Good… So all our forces have arrived. Now we can turn back and take down the German fleet with the auxiliary vessels. 
No… no… We've been tricked by the British fleet… If this continues, we will all be terminated… Everyone retreat… 
Pursue the German fleet and shoot them down
We've succeeded~ We really put the hurt on that German fleet. Now the ball's in our court. Report to the Admiralty on our successful mission..
Attention! We're too far away from Charlie fleet. 
We failed to maintain our distance with the Charlie fleet. We must retreat. 
Mission Goal 1: Destroy the patrolling vessel. 
Patrol has completed
Charlie fleet has been sunken
Alpha fleet has been sunken
Alpha fleet, please move to the point to wait for attack!!
Raid the enemy patrolling vessel and shoot it down. Lure the German fleet at Port Heligoland and take it down with our friendly forces. 
We have our orders. We're supposed to patrol the area to secure the safety of the current location.
You may encounter enemy submarines, so keep an eye out for them on your patrol. If you find any submarines, retreat immediately.
Head to the patrolling location and start your patrols 
We detected an enemy vessel. Retreat while avoiding the submarine and survey the patrolling area. If you get a chance, then shoot down the submarine. 
Move to the next patrolling location. 
We completed the patrol while avoiding the submarine. The submarine won't be able to move on its own. 
We will retreat right away and join you. 
Captain! We have orders from Admiralty to shoot down German Admiral Graf von Spee's fleet. 
Accordingly, the Canopus, Defense, and Good Hope shall come to support us. 
I see. We shall wait for reinforcements, then.
Captain... They say that sending reinforcements is no longer possible, and the Canopus made its way back due to engine problems… At least the Good Hope made it... 
This is the Good Hope.. We will join the fleet right away.. 
No… We're supposed to stop the Admiral Graf von Spee's fleet with just this? We will move the command center to the Good Hope first.
All fleets, move at top speed and try monitoring the communication between the German vessels.. 
Chrrrrr… This is Leipzig… supply ship move to the coordinates and provide supplies to Admiral Graf von Spee's fleet….
Okay… We should target their supplies… 
Captain, we have the location of Admiral Graf von Spee's fleet… What shall we do…?
Mmm.. The Admiralty keeps asking for it, so we have no choice… Approach them quickly before any of the German fleets detect us. We'll make the first attack.. 
The German fleet is within our shooting range.. All fleets attack!
The Monmouth and Good Hope are shot down… We can't hold off any more.. Retreat…
Good! We shot down all the enemy vessels… Report to the Admiralty right away and turn back… Good job, everyone…
Retreat while avoiding enemy vessels.
Shoot down Admiral Graf von Spee's fleet.
Captain, all vessels from the patrol have started fuel supply. 
Good.. Make sure that the fuel supply and all other repairs are completed as quickly as possible and that they get some rest.
Report. Canopus patrol says that German fleet movement was detected…                                                          Their route is suspected to reach here, Port Stanley. 
Our fleet will move to Falkland for a surprise attack.
Gneisenau and Nuremberg must quickly move to Port Stanley and ambush its beacon and port facilities.
"We are in danger! We must interrupt the course of the German fleet.
Prepare the Canopus for fire against the German fleet."
German fleet is approaching from 13,000 yards away! Canopus is ready to attack… Front, back, fire!
Emergency! Emergency!                                                                                       Admiral, that shot just attacked our friendly fleet. 
Argh… Where did that come from… No….                                                                             It's impossible to shoot from behind a mountain…
Gneisenau stovepipe shot!
That's it… We can't just sit still while we get damaged from shots fired from God knows where. All fleets, retreat southeast…
Admiral Sturdee, we are all ready to make sortie.
Good… Catch up to the retreating German fleet with full speed and sink them all. We must not let them escape. Eliminate them!
